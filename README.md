# React and Node Weather Web App

A simple web app using React and Node to tell the weather of a selected city.

## Getting Started

Install dependancies with `npm i` in the project directory

## Why Node.JS?

I know I could have just made an axios.get request from the React Application, but I wanted some beginner, basic experience making an API with Node.JS and this was a good chance for that.
