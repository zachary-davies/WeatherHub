# React and Node Weather Web App

A simple web app using React and Node to tell the weather of a selected city.

## Pre-reqs
Node and react

## Installation

Install dependancies with `npm i` in both the server and client directors

## Running the application

First you need to get the Node server running with `npm start` in the server directory, then in a new terminal window, do the same `npm start` in the client directory.

## Using the app
The application itself is pretty simple. Type in a city into the search bar and hit enter to see the weather for that city.

## Why Node.JS?

I know I could have just made an axios.get request from the React Application directly to the weather api, but I wanted some beginner, basic experience making an API with Node.JS and this was a good chance for that.
